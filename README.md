# TypeScript based Simple Worldbuilding Unoffical Foundry VTTRPG Game System

## For GMs

Paste this link to the Manifest URL: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callunaborealis/simple-worldbuilding-ts/master/dist/system.json>.

## For Developers

This system was initialised using the [Simple Worldbuilding System](https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/worldbuilding) developed by the Foundry Network as it already gives GMs more flexibility to customise the game system without waiting for developers and would be most compatible with the [FoundryVTT system](https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/guides/SD-tutorial/SD012-Other-options).

### Build process

`npm rum build` - Compiles your source code into the essential release files (Game files `system.zip`, and Manifest file `system.json`).

```txt
`src` (Source code) -> `build` (Transpiled code) -> `dist` (Essential files prepared for release)
```
